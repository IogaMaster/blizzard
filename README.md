With blizzard you can install a nixos system in place.

- 🏗️ Runs pre-flight checks:
    - 📦 Checks for kexec functionality
- ⚙️ Builds the installer and packs it into the kexec image:
    - 🏭 Creates Stage 2 installer
    - 🫙 Builds the kexec image, with the Stage 2 installer and components built in.
    - ✅ Finalizes and preforms verification
- 🎉 Preforms the install.
    - 🏃 Runs the finished kexec image 
    - 🗳️ Preforms on the fly checks
    - 📋 Formats and paritions drives with disko
    - 📥 Uses nixos-anywhere to install.

#### Why?

I already had a install script, but it was kinda rudimentary. So this is a better more streamlined install wizard.
